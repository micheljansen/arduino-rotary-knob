Arduino library that models an incremental rotary encoder knob.

The current implementation models a 12-step quadrature encoder
that outputs 2-bit gray code, like the 318-ENC130175F-12PS 
(Ref.#: TW-700198) sold by SparkFun Electronics.

Usage
Place the directory with Knob.h and Knob.cpp inside the "libraries"
directory of your Arduino sketchbook.

To add it to your skech, go to Sketch > Import Library.

Using the library in your program is easy: 
call setup(pinA, pinB) in the setup() method of your Arduino sketch. 
Then: run read() from within the loop() to get the result.
-1 means "left", 0 "no change" and 1 "right" 
(or the other way around if you reverse the wiring).
